\resumeItemListStart
    \resumeItem{Developed compiler for a C subset from scratch using C++ and LLVM framework, implementing all phases of compilation including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation for primitive types and arrays}
    \resumeItem{Achieved a 1.7x speedup on benchmarking programs by implementing an alloca2reg promotion optimization pass, reducing memory allocations, loads, and stores}
    \resumeItem{Achieved up to 5x speedup in sample programs by designing an optimization pass to eliminate redundant global loads utilizing the LLVM framework to perform loop analysis and code re-write}
